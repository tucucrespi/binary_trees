Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a binary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the standard library
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

Basic Binary Tree

/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
Binary Search Tree

typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
AVL Tree

typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
Max Binary Heap

typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
Note: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they don’t follow any kind of rule.

Print function
To match the examples in the tasks, you are given this function

This function is used only for visualization purposes. You don’t have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction

# Tasks

And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.
